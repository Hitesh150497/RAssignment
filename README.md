•	Performed data manipulation by filtering, and putting conditions, removing missing values, handled duplicate variables.
•	Arranged data by reordering and renaming the variables.
•	Found the dependent and independent variables within dataset.
•	Performed mathematical and statistical operations.
•	Plotted scatterplots and bar plots and found co-relation between variables.
•	At last, extracted RMD file into PDF format.
